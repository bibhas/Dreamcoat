Automatic Color Scheming from Logo Images

This project demonstrates two colour quantisation/clustering methods used together to quickly analyse a logo image for its dominant colours.

Some other analysis tools are included which attempt to detect the background colour of an image, and choose an appropriate colour for text on this background.
